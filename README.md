# ThriveThreads
This is ThriveThreads! A project we built for NwPlus' cmd-f 2024 hackathon. 

We created this website to encourage community building and make information on health and wellness accessible for everyone regardless of language!

## Tech Stack
We used React.js, Node.js, and CSS/HTML to build our website. We also implemented Cohere's API as the large language model that successfully generates answers to questions and translates text from any language to the user's preferred language. 

## Challenges We Faced
With big ideas in the beginning, we had to scale down to narrow our scope and build a minimum viable product. The biggest obstacle we faced was our effort to incorporate a back-end using MongoDB Atlas. Unfortunately, we were unable to connect the database with our front-end in time, but we learned a lot by trying and hope to achieve this for future projects or hackathons!
